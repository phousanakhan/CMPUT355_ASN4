    The rule of this game is simple. The first person to make a straight line 
    of four in their own piece wins the game. Hence, the name Connect4. Keep
    in mind, the line can be vertical, horizontal or diagonal. Good luck !

    The roots of Connect-4 can be trace back to the Tic-Tac-Toe, a simple game
    that one can win by making a straight line of three in their own piece. One
    difference between Connect-4 and Tic-tac-Toe is that there's a restriction of
    the piece placement in Connect-4. That is, the piece must be 'drop' into the 
    board. As a result, restricting the players from placing a piece anywhere on 
    the board. The name 'Connect-4' was coined by Milton Bradley, the founder of
    Milton Bradley Company.
